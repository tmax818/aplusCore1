                <p style="">The power supply unit (PSU) delivers direct current (DC) low voltage power to the PC
                    components. A PSU contains a rectifier to convert alternating current (AC ) building power to DC
                    voltage output, transformers to step down to lower voltages, and filters and regulators to ensure
                    consistent output voltage levels. The other important component in the PSU is the fan, which
                    dissipates the heat generated.</p>
                <p>The power supply's size and shape determine its compatibility with the system case, in terms of

                    the ATX form factor.</p>

                <p style="">Each PSU has a number of power connectors attached. The power connectors supply DC voltage
                    to the motherboard and devices at 3.3 VDC, 5 VDC, and 12 VDC. Not all components use power at
                    precisely these voltages. Voltage regulators are used to correct the voltage supplied from the PSU
                    to the voltage required by the component. The motherboard’s power port is referred to as the P1
                    connector. A PSU will also have a number of Molex and/or SATA device power connectors and 4/6/8-pin
                    connectors for use with CPU and PCIe adapter card power ports.</p>

                    over the motherboard and expel warmed air from the fan positioned at the top of the back of the

                <p>A PC is often much less valuable than the data that it stores and processes. This means that the
                    reliability and performance of the devices used to store system files and user files is of critical
                    importance. If these storage devices fail, the PC will not work, and valuable information may be
                    lost. By identifying the types and characteristics of storage devices, you will be prepared to
                    select, install, and maintain them to ensure a reliable computing environment for users.</p>

                <p style="">Non-volatile storage devices hold data when the system is powered off. These devices are
                    also referred to as mass storage. Mass storage devices use magnetic, optical, or solid-state
                    technology to store data.</p>
                <p>A mass storage device installed as an internal component is referred to as a fixed disk. Storage
                    devices are produced in a number of standard widths: 5.25 inches, 3.5<span> inches</span>, and
                    2.5<span> inches</span>. The computer chassis has several drive bays to fit these form factors.
                    <span>Form </span>factor bays<span> with a 5.25-inch width</span> are provided with removable panels
                    so that they can be used with devices that have removable media, such as DVD drives and smart card
                    readers.</p>
                <p>A fixed disk is typically installed to a drive bay using a caddy. You screw the drive into the caddy,
                    then screw the caddy into the drive bay. A caddy can also allow you to fit a drive of a different
                    size to the bay. For example, you can fit a 2.5-inch drive in a 3.5<span>-inch</span> bay or a
                    3.5<span>-inch</span> drive in a 5.25<span>-inch</span> bay by using an adapter caddy. Some caddies
                    use rails so that you can pull the drive out without having to open the case.</p>

                <p>Removable mass storage devices and removable media allow data to be archived from the PC and
                    transferred between PCs. External storage devices are also used for backup and data transfer or to
                    provide a drive type not available as an internal unit. A device such as an external hard drive
                    would typically be connected to the computer via a USB or Thunderbolt port.</p>
                <p>Apart from cost, several factors impact the choice of mass storage device:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reliability</strong>—This concerns both the risk of total device failure and the risk of
                        partial data corruption. Reliability and expected lifespan are rated by various statistics that
                        are different for each technology type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance</strong>—When comparing different types of storage technology, you need to
                        evaluate performance for the type of data transfer that the device will use predominantly. For
                        example, read and write performance have different characteristics. There are also differences
                        between sequential access (reading data from the same "block" as might happen when transferring
                        a large file) and random access (reading data from different locations on the drive or
                        transferring lots of small files). Along with the data throughput measured in MB/s or GB/s, you
                        may need to consider the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) that can be
                        achieved by a device for different kinds of data transfer operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use</strong>—Reliability and performance factors can only be properly evaluated when
                        considering use. Examples of how storage is used include running an OS, hosting a database
                        application, streaming audio/video data, as removable media, and for data backup and archiving.
                        These use cases have different cost, reliability, and performance considerations.</li>

                    drive configuration using two disks. Each write operation is duplicated on the second disk in the

                    performance somewhat. This strategy is the simplest way of protecting a single disk against failure.
                    If one disk fails, the other takes over. There is little impact on performance during this, so
                    availability remains good, but the failed disk should be replaced as quickly as possible as there is
                    no longer any redundancy. When the disk is replaced, it must be populated with data from the other
                    disk. Performance while rebuilding is reduced, though RAID 1 is better than other levels in that
                    respect and the rebuilding process is generally shorter than for parity-based RAID.&nbsp;</p>

                    0) but with distributed parity. Distributed parity means that error correction information is spread
                    across all the disks in the array. The data and parity information are managed so that the two are
                    always on different disks. If a single disk fails, enough information is spread across the remaining
                    disks to allow the data to be reconstructed. Stripe sets with parity offer the best performance for
                    read operations. However, when a disk has failed, the read performance is degraded by the need to
                    recover the data using the parity information. Also, all normal write operations suffer reduced
                    performance due to the parity calculation.&nbsp;</p>

                <p style="">RAID 5 requires a minimum of three drives but can be configured with more. This allows more
                    flexibility in determining the overall capacity of the array than is possible with RAID 1. A "hard"
                    maximum number of devices is set by the controller or OS support, but the number of drives used is
                    more likely to be determined by practicalities such as cost and risk. Adding more disks increases
                    the chance of failure. If more than one disk fails, the volume will be unavailable.</p>
                <p>The level of fault tolerance and available disk space is inverse. As you add disks to the set, fault
                    tolerance decreases but usable disk space increases. If you configure a RAID 5 set using three
                    disks, a third of each disk is set aside for parity. If four are used, one<span>-</span>quarter is
                    reserved on each disk. Using a three 80 GB disk configuration, you would have a 160 GB usable

                    (DVDs), and Blu-ray Discs (BDs) are mainstream storage formats for music and video retail. All types
                    of optical media use a laser to read the data encoded on the disc surface. The discs are marketed as
                    being hard-wearing, but scratches can render them unreadable.</p>
                <p>These discs can also be used as storage media for PC data. Each disc type is available in recordable
                    and rewritable formats:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic recordable media can be written to once only in a single session.</li>
                    <li>Multisession recordable media can be written to in more than one session, but data cannot be
                        erased.</li>
                    <li>Rewritable media can be written and erased in multiple sessions, up to a given number of write
                        cycles.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each optical disc type has different capacity and transfer rate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CD has a maximum capacity of 700 MB and is available in recordable (CD-R) and rewritable (CD-RW)
                        formats. The base transfer rate of a CD is 150 KBps.</li>
                    <li>DVD has a capacity of 4.7 GB for a single layer, single-sided disc up to about 17 GB for a
                        dual-layer, double-sided disc. At launch, there were competing DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW recordable
                        and rewritable formats, but most drives can use either, designated by the ± symbol. The base
                        transfer rate for DVD is 1.32 MBps, equivalent to 9x CD speed.</li>
                    <li>Blu-ray has a capacity of 25 GB per layer. The base speed for Blu-ray is 4.5 MBps, and the
                        maximum theoretical rate is 16x (72 MBps).</li>

                    recording/rewriting is marketed with three speeds, always expressed as the record/rewrite/read speed
                    (for example, 24x/16x/52x). New drives are generally multi-format, but you may come across older

                    used on a player from the same region. On a PC, the region can usually be set using device
                    properties. The firmware normally prevents this from being changed more than a couple of times.</p>

                <p>Modern system RAM is implemented as a type called Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access

                <ul>
                    <li>Dynamic RAM stores each data bit as an electrical charge within a single bit cell. A bit cell
                        consists of a capacitor to hold a charge (the cell represents 1 if there is a charge and 0 if
                        there is not) and a transistor to read the contents of the capacitor.</li>
                    <li>Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) is so-called because its speed is synchronized to the motherboard
                        system clock.</li>

                <p>DDR memory modules are labeled using the maximum theoretical bandwidth, such as PC1600, PC2100, and
                    so on. As an example of how this value is derived, consider DDR-200 PC-1600 memory:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The internal memory device clock speed and memory bus speed (between the memory devices and
                        memory controller) are both 100 MHz.</li>
                    <li>The data rate is double this as there are two operations per clock "tick." This is expressed in
                        units called megatransfers per second (200 MT/s). This gives the DDR-200 designation.</li>
                    <li>The peak transfer rate is 1600 MBps (200 MT/s multiplied by 8 bytes (64 bits) per transfer).
                        This gives the "PC-1600" designation. 1600 MBps is equivalent to 1.6 GBps.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Subsequent generations of DDR technology—DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5—increase bandwidth by multiplying
                    the bus speed, as opposed to the speed at which the actual memory devices work. This produces
                    scalable speed improvements without making the memory modules too unreliable or too hot. Design
                    improvements also increase the maximum possible capacity of each memory module.</p>

                <p>A memory module is a printed circuit board that holds a group of RAM devices that act as a single
                    unit. Memory modules are produced in different capacities. Each DDR generation sets an upper limit
                    on the maximum possible capacity. DDR for desktop system memory is packaged in a form factor called
                    dual inline memory module (DIMM). The notches (keys) on the module’s edge connector identify the DDR

                    is used for workstations and servers that require a high level of reliability. For each transfer,
                    ECC RAM performs a hash calculation on the data value and stores it as an 8-bit checksum. This
                    checksum requires an extra processor chip on the module and a 72-bit data bus rather than the
                    regular 64 bits. The memory controller performs the same calculation and should derive the same
                    checksum. This system can detect and correct single-bit errors and allow the PC to continue
                    functioning normally. ECC can also detect errors of 2, 3<span>,</span> or 4 bits but cannot correct
                    them. Instead, it will generate an error message and halt the system.</p>
                <p>Most types of ECC are supplied as registered DIMMs (RDIMMs). A registered DIMM uses an extra
                    component to reduce electrical load on the memory controller. This has a slight performance penalty,
                    but makes the system more reliable, especially if large amounts of memory are installed. Most types
                    of non-ECC memory are unbuffered DIMMs (UDIMMs). Some types of ECC RAM are packaged in UDIMMs,
                    though this is rarer.</p>
                <p>All these factors must be considered when selecting memory for a system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Both the motherboard and CPU must support ECC operation for it to be enabled.</li>
                    <li>Most motherboards support either UDIMMs or RDIMMs, but not both.</li>
                    <li>If a motherboard does support both, UDIMM and RDIMM modules cannot be mixed on the same
                        motherboard. The system will not boot if there are different types.</li>
                    <li>Mixing non-ECC UDIMMs and ECC UDIMMs is unlikely to work.</li>
                </ul>

                    Unlike AMD and Intel, ARM do not manufacture CPUs. Instead, they produce designs that hardware
                    vendors customize and manufacture. ARM designs are used in the current generation of Apple hardware,
                    in most Android smartphones and tablets (notably by the vendors Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Samsung), in
                    many Chromebooks, and in some Windows tablets and laptops. A typical ARM design implements a
                    system-on-chip (SoC). SoC means that all the controllers—video, sound, networking, and storage—are
                    part of the CPU. ARM designs use fewer, less complex instructions than is typical of x86. These
                    features allow much better power and thermal efficiency, meaning longer battery life and the use of
                    passive (fanless) cooling.</p>

                    <p>An x86/x64 platform is complex instruction set computing (CISC), meaning that it uses a larger
                        number (say around 1,000) of relatively more complex instructions. A single complex instruction
                        might generate multiple operations across the CPU’s registers and take multiple clock cycles to
                        complete. Reduced ISC (RISC) uses a small number of simpler instructions (say 100). This means
                        that tasks require the execution of more instructions than with CISC, but each takes precisely
                        one clock cycle. Because there are fewer instructions overall, RISC can make better use of the
                        CPU registers and cache.</p>

                <p>For an operating system and hardware drivers to run on an ARM-based device, they must be redesigned
                    and compiled to use the ARM instruction set. While this task is typically within the reach of
                    operating system developers, converting existing x86/x64 software applications to run on a different
                    instruction set is an onerous task. Another option is support for emulation. This means that the ARM
                    device runs a facsimile of an x86 or x64 environment. Windows 10 ARM-based devices use emulation to
                    run x86 and x64 software apps. Emulation typically imposes a significant performance penalty,

                <p>Given the architectural features just discussed, the speed at which the CPU runs is generally seen as

                    as HyperThreading by Intel. A thread is a stream of instructions generated by a software
                    application. Most applications run a single process in a single thread; software that runs multiple
                    parallel threads within a process is said to be multithreaded. SMT allows the threads to run through
                    the CPU at the same time. This reduces the amount of "idle time" the CPU spends waiting for new
                    instructions to process. To the OS, it seems as though there are two or more CPUs installed.</p>
                <p>Another approach is to use two or more physical CPUs, referred to as symmetric multiprocessing (SMP).
                    An SMP-aware OS can then make efficient use of the processing resources available to run application
                    processes on whichever CPU is "available." This approach is not dependent on software applications

                    models that support SMP.</p>
                <p>Improvements in CPU fabrication techniques led to the ability to expand compute resources by
                    fabricating multiple CPU cores on a single package. A <strong>single-core</strong> CPU has a single
                    execution unit and set of registers implemented on a single package. A dual-core CPU is essentially
                    two processors combined in the same package. This means that there are two execution units and sets
                    of registers. Each core will also have its own cache plus access to a shared cache. This is referred

                    reinstalling the same heat sink, clean old thermal grease from the surfaces and apply a small amount
                    of new grease in an X . Do not apply too much—if it overruns<span>,</span> the excess could

                <p>The nature of the current CPU market means that there is rapid turnover of models. Each vendor
                    releases a CPU design with a number of architectural improvements and quite often with a new socket
                    design. This is referred to as a CPU’s generation. In each generation, the manufacturer releases
                    several models.</p>
                <p>Motherboards are specific to either Intel or AMD CPUs. Typically, <strong>motherboard
                        compatibility</strong> is limited to the same generation of CPUs. The CPU must be supported by
                    both the physical form factor of the motherboard’s <span><strong>CPU socket</strong></span> and by
                    the motherboard’s chipset. There are limited opportunities to upgrade the CPU model while keeping
                    the same motherboard<span>,</span> and such upgrades rarely offer much value.</p>
                <p>Within each generation, CPU brands and models target different market segments, such as desktop,

                <p><strong>Desktop</strong> is shorthand for a basic PC as used at home or in the office. The term

                    horizontally on a desk, rather than the vertical tower or all-in-one configurations used today. The
                    desktop segment covers a wide range of performance levels, from budget to gaming PC. These
                    performance levels are reflected in the CPU manufacturer’s ranges, with multiple models of Intel
                    Core (i3/i5/i7/i9) and AMD Ryzen (A and 1 up to 9) CPUs at price points ranging from tens of dollars
                    (i3 or Ryzen 1 series) to thousands (Ryzen Threadripper Pro). Intel also uses its historic brands,
                    such as Pentium and Celeron, to market budget chips.</p>
                <p>Current Intel desktop socket designs include LGA 2011, LGA 1151, LGA 2066, LGA 1200, and LGA 1700.
                    Most current AMD CPUs use the PGA form factor socket AM4.</p>
